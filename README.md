## 🤖 CSAT Predictor – Customer Satisfaction Score Prediction from Reviews
CSAT Predictor is an end-to-end Machine Learning system designed to predict
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores based on customer reviews and sentiment.
The project analyzes textual feedback and sentiment signals to estimate customer satisfaction levels (1–5).
By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models, the system helps businesses
understand customer feedback, detect dissatisfaction early, and improve service quality.
🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate CSAT scores using customer reviews.

Predicting customer satisfaction helps businesses:

Identify unhappy customers early
Improve service quality
Automate feedback analysis
Enhance customer experience
🧠 Problem Definition
Type: Supervised Learning
Approach: Classification (Multi-class: 1–5)
🔹 Input:
Review (text data)
Sentiment (categorical)
🔹 Output:
CSAT Score (1–5)

👉 The problem is treated as a multi-class classification task for better performance and interpretability.

⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ Text Preprocessing
Lowercasing
Removing punctuation
Stopword removal
Cleaning noisy text
2️⃣ Feature Engineering
Convert text → numerical features using TF-IDF
Limit features using max_features to avoid overfitting
Combine:
Text features (TF-IDF)
Sentiment feature
3️⃣ Model Training

Models used:

Logistic Regression (Baseline)
Random Forest (Ensemble Model)
XGBoost (Boosting Model)
4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix

Example:

Logistic Regression → 78%
Random Forest → 85%
XGBoost → 88%
📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of customer reviews along with sentiment and CSAT scores.

Key Columns:
Review → Customer feedback (text)
Sentiment → Positive / Neutral / Negative
CSAT Score → Target variable (1–5)
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed analysis on:

Distribution of CSAT scores
Mean, median, and spread of ratings
Relationship between sentiment and CSAT
Detection of class balance

Insights:

Average CSAT ≈ 3 (neutral satisfaction)
Balanced distribution across classes
Strong correlation between sentiment and CSAT
🔄 Data Preprocessing

Steps performed:

Handling missing values
Text cleaning using NLP
Stopword removal (with care for negations like "not")
Encoding sentiment column
Feature scaling (where required)
🤖 Machine Learning Models
1️⃣ Logistic Regression
Baseline model
Simple and interpretable
Fast training
2️⃣ Random Forest
Ensemble of decision trees
Handles non-linear patterns
Reduced overfitting
3️⃣ XGBoost
Gradient boosting model
High performance on structured data
Tuned for optimal results
⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning

Performed using:

GridSearchCV
RandomizedSearchCV

Improved model performance by tuning:

Number of estimators
Tree depth
Learning rate
Regularization parameters

▶️ How to Run
1️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
2️⃣ Run the app
streamlit run app.py
📈 Business Use Cases
🧑‍💼 Customer Experience
Predict dissatisfaction before surveys
Improve service quality
📊 Feedback Analysis
Automate review analysis
Detect negative trends early
📌 Important Notes
Same TF-IDF vectorizer must be used during training and prediction
Input features must match training features (text + sentiment)
Large datasets are not included due to size limits
